In below Figure, a link is driven through a shaft after a gear reduction. Model the link as 
rigid with mass of 10 Kg located at a point 30 cm from the shaft axis. Assume that the gears 
are rigid and that the reduction, is large. The shaft is steel and must be 30 cm long, if the 
design specifications call for the center of link mass to undergo accelerations of 2.0 g, what 
should the shaft diameter be to limit dynamic deflections to 0.1 radian at the joint angle?![[image.png|374x209]]


轴所受力为：$$F=ma=20g \hspace{0.3cm}\mathrm{N}$$
力矩为：$$\mathrm{T=Fr=6g~N\cdot m}$$受扭矩作用的圆形轴,扭转变形为：$$\theta=\frac{TL}{JG}$$$$\mathrm{J}=\frac{\pi d^4}{32}$$由上两式可得：$$ \hspace{3.6cm}\begin{aligned}d^{4}&=\frac{TL}{G\theta}\cdot\frac{32}{\pi}\\&=\frac{6\times9.8\times0.3}{7.5\times10^{10}\times0.1}\times\frac{32}{3.14}\\&=0.0124^4\mathrm{m}^4\end{aligned}$$故轴的直径为：$$d=1.24\ cm$$
